# Simple Interest Calculator

This project is a simple interest calculator that computes the simple interest based on the principal amount, rate of interest, and time period.

## Formula

Simple Interest is calculated using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100

## How It Works

- The user provides:
  - Principal amount
  - Rate of interest
  - Time (in years)
- The calculator applies the formula and returns the simple interest.

## Example

If:
- Principal = 1000
- Rate = 5%
- Time = 2 years

Then:
Simple Interest = (1000 × 5 × 2) / 100 = 100
